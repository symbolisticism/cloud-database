# Overview

I wanted to learn how cloud databases work, and I wanted to create my own implementation of one. Having never used NoSQL before, this was a completely new experience for me. I know that cloud databases are a large part of many systems nowadays, so I wanted to get my foot in the door and learn something about them. I know that this experience will provide to be a valuable skill in the future.

I wrote a program that interacts with a populated cloud database. The program connects to a database and it gives the user options for interacting with the database. It allows the user to add a new item to the database, add quantity to an existing item, use quantity from an existing item, and search the inventory of the database. It is a very input/output driven program with a lot of built-in hard-coded functionality.

I wrote this software, as mentioned above, to learn about how cloud databases work and to gain experience so that I can use it in future endeavors. I am interested in working with databases in the future, and I know that cloud databases are heavily used.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

I used Firebase from Google to create a cloud database. It is a NoSQL database, which means it is not structured like a traditional relational database. Instead of rows, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys you have collections, documents, and fields.

As described before, this is a NoSQL database, which means it is not structured like a traditional relational database. 

# Development Environment

I used the Firebase web application for the cloud database and I used VS Code and Python for the development of the software that drives the cloud database manipulation.
